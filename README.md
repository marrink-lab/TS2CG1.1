# TS2CG version 1.1

Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute and Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials,
University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

TS2CG converts triangulated surfaces (TS) to coarse-grained membrane models for molecular simulation.
It also works as a backmapping algorithm from dynamically triangulated surfaces simulations to CG molecular dynamics simulations or 
to take electron microscopy tomography data and build structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

TS2CG is implemented in C++ and includes two separate scripts. Pointillism (PLM) and CG Membrane Builder (PCG).

Note: There will be no further updates to this version. More develoments will be done on version 1.2 (https://github.com/weria-pezeshkian/TS2CG1.2)
