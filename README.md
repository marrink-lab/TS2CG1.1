TS2CG converts triangulated surfaces (TS) to coarse-grained membrane models for molecular simulation.
It also works as a backmapping algorithm from dynamically triangulated surfaces simulations to CG molecular dynamics simulations or 
to take electron microscopy tomography data and build structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

TS2CG is implemented in C++ and includes two separate scripts. Pointillism (PLM) and CG Membrane Builder (PCG).
